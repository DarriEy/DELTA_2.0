        The hydrological cycle, also known as the water cycle, is the continuous movement of water on, above, and below the surface of the Earth.

        Key processes include:
        * Evaporation: Water changes from liquid to vapor, primarily from oceans and other water bodies.
        * Condensation: Water vapor cools and changes back into liquid, forming clouds.
        * Precipitation: Water falls back to Earth as rain, snow, sleet, or hail.
        * Infiltration: Water soaks into the ground, replenishing groundwater.
        * Runoff: Water flows over the land surface, eventually reaching rivers, lakes, and oceans.
        * Transpiration: Water is released into the atmosphere by plants.

        Understanding the hydrological cycle is fundamental to hydrological modeling.

        A watershed, also called a drainage basin or catchment, is an area of land where all surface water converges to a single point, typically a river, lake, or ocean.

        Key characteristics of a watershed include:
        * Area: The total land area draining to a common outlet.
        * Slope: The steepness of the terrain, which influences runoff velocity.
        * Land Cover: The type of vegetation and land use, which affects infiltration and evapotranspiration.
        * Soil Type: The characteristics of the soil, which determine infiltration capacity and water storage.

        Watersheds are important units for hydrological analysis and management.
